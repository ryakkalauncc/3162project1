<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>For this project I picked the student stress monitoring dataset. The dataset explores the cause of student stress in college students between the ages of 18-21 all across the United States. This dataset is based off the respones of 843 different college students across the country, the survey contained 25 different questions and student responses were condensed into 20 different key features that are grouped into 5 main categories: Psychological factors, Physiological factors, Environmental factors, Academic factors, and Social factors. My hope is to figure out which factors most impact stress levels and which category holds the most impact on the daily life of college students in the United States.</b>
<b>I also hope to find a practical use where a university or even students themselves can have a tangible way to see if controllable factors in their life, like sleep quality can make an effect on their stress levels. I see there is also a column for academic performance that students and universities can use this data in order to boost academic performance. I could also imagine universities using this data to see if there is a way they can better help assist their students to fight stress and boost student well being effectively.</b>
<h2>Pre-processing the Data</h2>
<b>The data was already free of nulls when I first opened it however I still made sure the column names were consistent and checked for other errors in consistency. I did this by loading the csv file (StressLevelDataset.csv) into pandas and did a few checks. For the most part the data was numerical and formatted in a way that works for me. This dataset was ready for analysis and visualization.</b>
